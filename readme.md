# Google Analytics WordPress Nav Menu Event Tracking #

A very long title for a simple plugin: what it does is insert a span element after the links in your navigation menus and also, adds 4 metaboxes for each menu item in the Custom Menus Interface.
So for each menu item, you can configure what to track individually.
When someone clicks a link in the navigation, an event listener will send the event to your Google Analytics.
